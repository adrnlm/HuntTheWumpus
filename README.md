# HuntTheWumpus

Originally Hunt the Wumpus is an early computer game, based on a simple hide and seek format featuring a mysterious monster 
(the Wumpus) that lurks deep inside a network of rooms. It was originally developed as a text-based game written in BASIC. Due 
to the source code availability the game has since been ported to various programming languages and platforms including 
graphical versions. It has been cited as an early example of a survival horror game.

This is a clone of a simpler version of the original game.
